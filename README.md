## Projects

### [Concentrate Cake Classification using CNN](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18SxKdHgZjwPC4NkpFZ9iaYhndYNny6B1?usp=sharing)

Developed a model to classify concentrate cake quality based its video using **tensorflow**. Reached training accuracy 91% and validation accuracy 82%. The data is confidential.

### [Pipe Slurry Thickness Prediction using Support Vector Regression](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MIobq3W0GQ_jrwXbIbptKTJbbV1O9dj-?usp=sharing)

Developed a model to predict the pipeline thickness using Support Vector Regression and reached 4% MAPE. The model is used to find best parameter so that tha slurry thickness reduction is minimum using Solver Excel.

### [Tobacco Garangan Classification Model using MobileNet CNN](https://github.com/Arsan24/Mbako)

Developed a mobile App that can classify Tobacco Garangan quality based its images using **tensorflow** with team. We found that the best pre-trained model to classify the case is MobileNet. We reached training accuracy 98% and validation accuracy 97%.

### [Water Feasibility Classification](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/132S8A9gQmRG5cIqFdh2bIGIFcX33KfKd?usp=sharing)

Using **Python** and **neural random forest** to classify water feasibility (binary) with 38 factors consisting of 11990 entries. Reached **90.83% training accuracy**.

### [Predicting Value at Risk with GUI Matlab](https://github.com/sandyayesha/VaRmatlab)

Used **Matlab** to make Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can predict Value at Risk (VaR) with 4 different methods.

### [K-Means Clustering with GUI R](https://github.com/sandyayesha/GUI-R-KMeans)

Used **R** to make Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can cluster data with K-Means Clustering method.
