## Projects
### [Tobacco Garangan Classification Model using MobileNet CNN](https://github.com/Arsan24/Mbako)

Developed a mobile App that can classify Tobacco Garangan quality based its images using **tensorflow** with team. We found that the best pre-trained model to classify the case is MobileNet. We reached training accuracy 98% and validation accuracy 97%.
